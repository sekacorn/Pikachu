# Pikachu
It is a Pikachu Program that is supposed to print 'Hello world,' but it prints 'HELLN WNRMDRMLCRMLLLLLLLL' because of syntax errors and a lack of focus when writing it.
It was written through trial and error using the Pika interpreter.
Please ensure that there is no newline at the end of the code if you receive an error message

Here is where you can run it
